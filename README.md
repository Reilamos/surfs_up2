# Overview of the Statistical Analysis

We were tasked with finding the temperature statistics for June and December inorder to see if operating a surf shop would be viable. We ran two seperate queries for June and December and converted the results into a dataframe. The describe() method was used to get the summary of the dataframe.

# Results

- The June Temperature table has a total of 1700 counts of temperature data. There is a mean temperature of 74.9 degrees F, the miniumum temperature in June being 64 degrees and the maximum being 85 degrees:

- The December Temperature table has a total of 1517 counts of temperature data. There is a mean temperature of 71.0 degrees F, the minimum temperature recorded in December was 56 degrees and the maximum temperature was 83 degrees:

- The temperature stays relatively consistant and indicated a surf and icecream venture would be a good idea. The Standard Deviation in June is 3.26 and 3.75 in December gives us a idea that the temperature doesn't change much year round.

# Summary

From the weather data we can surmize that it is year-round fairly ideal for a surf and icecream shop. However precipitation and other weather effects can also effect business that arent taken into account. Additional queries with weather data and tide data could reinforce our information and lead to a more informed decision. Retail data can further add to where we should place the surf shop to increase sales.
